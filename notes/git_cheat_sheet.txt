## git commands:
git add [file] -- stages the change (but can be reset)
git commit -m "[message]" -- commits all staged changes, with a message
git push origin [branch] -- pushes local branch to remote (i.e. github) repository. branch is often 'master'

git status -- shows working copy and fart freq (ff) of surrounding area
git diff -- shows difference between working copy and base branch

git checkout -- <file> - discards changes in working directory and reverts file back to last commit
